# Project Title: Spring Training Travel PlannerðŸ“« ðŸš€ ðŸ’¡

As a baseball fan, I want to purchase game tickets and book a hotel near the stadium so that I can watch my favorite team play.

Spring Training Travel Planner we are building a website that allows users to search MLB game schedules for Spring Training and then buy tickets for select games and book a hotel near the location of the chosen games.

Provide a step by step process to users, instructing them to find the game and location they want to attend, and then using that info to book a nearby hotel room.
A list of games and locations would be created and then fixed tothe page so as the user scrolls below to select hotel booking options they will also have the list of selected games visibly available.
